### Hi there, this is MD SHAHIB KHAN ðŸ‘‹

An aspiring full-stack developer, Recently completed my training at Pyspiders Banglore - A well-known training institute all over India.

## About Me
An aspiring full-stack developer aims to master both frontend and backend web development. They seek to acquire essential skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating interactive user interfaces. Additionally, they intend to explore server-side programming languages (e.g., Python, Node.js) and databases (e.g., PlSQL, SQL++) to develop robust backend systems. They aim to use Git for version control and are keen on learning frontend frameworks like React or Angular to enhance productivity. Furthermore, they plan to gain proficiency in backend frameworks such as Django to build scalable applications. Security, API design, and deployment to cloud platforms are also on their agenda. With a continuous learning mindset, they aspire to build a diverse portfolio of projects and actively seek feedback from developer communities to improve their coding skills.
